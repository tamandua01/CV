As the sole professional in the organization with expertise in these areas, I independently manage all data-related projects, collaborating closely with various departments to ensure alignment with their needs and goals.

I am proficient in Python programming and specialize in delivering data-driven insights through Excel and Power BI. 

I also have foundational knowledge of Clinical Trials, gained through the CRA course at Phase SMO.

Given the job description, I am confident in my ability to meet your needs. If there are any doubts or areas youâ€™d like to explore further, I would be delighted to discuss them in an interview.

Looking forward to the opportunity to contribute to your team.

Best regards,
